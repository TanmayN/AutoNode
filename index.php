		<h2>Welcome to AutoNode!</h2>
		<p>AutoNode is an automatic node deployment system meant to be used for Linux servers, as it works on a basis of shell scripts.<br>
		As it is still under development, relying on AutoNode with production/enterprise servers is highly unrecommended as it may fail.</p>
		<br>
		<b><u>Planned Features</u></b>
		<ul>
			<li>Server Stats</li>
			<li>Automatic Deployment</li>
			<li>DNS Management</li>
			<li>Distributed Command Deployment</li>
			<li><b>Suggestions are open, please contact me on IRC if you'd like to see something implemented</b></li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		<u><b>Contact Information</b></u>
		<p>If you would like to contact me, I am available on IRC.<br>
		Message Tanmay on irc.rizon.net for help or suggestions.<br>
		Thank you!</p>
